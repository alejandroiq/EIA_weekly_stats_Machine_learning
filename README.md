# Modeling WTI Price Drivers from EIA WPSR Data

## Overview
This project analyzes 14 years of weekly petroleum market data from the U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) **Weekly Petroleum Status Report (WPSR)** 
to identify and rank the fundamentals that most influence **WTI Cushing spot prices**.  

The goal is to provide **trading desks, risk managers, and executives** with a prioritized, directional driver list within minutes of the WPSR release, enabling faster, more confident decisions in a competitive market.

The project follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology, combining **regularized regression** and **tree-based ensemble** methods to handle collinearity, capture non-linearities, and deliver interpretable results.
